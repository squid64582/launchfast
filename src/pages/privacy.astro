      <br />
      <br />We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also
      let you know why we're collecting it and how it will be used.

      <br />We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we'll protect within commercially
      acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
